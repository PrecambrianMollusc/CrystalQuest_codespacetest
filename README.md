This was an attempt to run python code via code spaces directly from git hub.
The code all worked and redered however the rendering via the X window when run remote was very slow , and swicthing to local rendering moved out to html rendering which did not have the right formating and removed the layer switches

Wil keep this as a a repository for tets running of python scripts as that worked pretty well . It could potentaially be used if python is needed to maipulate code prior to running  gtlf three.js visualisation  

Need to figure how to keep 'codespace' running on the web
